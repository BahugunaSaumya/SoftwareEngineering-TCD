This repository is made for assignments in CSU33012-202122 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

This repository as of now has 3 branches (All the unit testing for java is done through eclipse and Junit 5 )

Main:-

This branch had the basic static input code for finding LCA in 2 languages java and python.

This branch now consists of my DAG code which is the merged with DAG branch

Edit1:-

This branch has a java program to creates a binary search tree using dynamic input and then returns the Lowest common ancestor of two nodes python code is the same as the main repository

unit:-

This branch uses unit testing on the LCA.java code of both the main and the edit1 branch, where the code with binary search tree asks for the nodes and the LCA(according to the user, allowing code to be checked for different nodes). unit-testing for the lca.py file is also attempted on this branch.

Biography:-

This branch contains the assignment to wrtie a Biography ona Software Engineer,I chose to write on Linus Torvalds the principal engineering behind Linux and git.

DAG:-

This branch contains the DAGtest.java test codes to find LCA and a DAG.java file to implement the function of finding LCA using a DAG.
DAG test is completed in two ways dynamic and static.

I had to implement a completley diffrent code for DAG  as my LCA code used Binary search tree dynamically which is completely useless for DAG in every way.

I have implemented DAG using BFS(Breadth First Search)

I had to implement a completley different code for DAG as my LCA code used Binary search tree dynamically which is completely useless for DAG in every way.

I have implemented DAG using BFS(Breadth First Search).
