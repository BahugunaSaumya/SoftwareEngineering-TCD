This Branch of my repository contains a different code than my main branch, this has the "Lca.java" code in a more dynamic way i.e user enters the value of the whole binary tree and the create funtion that is called and( I have commented on the code) creates a binary search tree. Lca funtions then looks for the LCA and returns the value also the functions allows the user to find Lowest common ancestor until they are done and want to exit the code.




I haven't changed the "lca.py" code to dynamic input as I am not much familiar with python.
